# UTAU_Song_Preview_Script
This is a script for outputting and previewing the voice synthesis software of [UTAU - 歌声合成ツール](https://utau-synth.com).
I'm not finished it yet.
It will take me more time to write it.
# Attention!
It can only be used in Chinese Windows environment. (Only Windows 10)
You need to open the UTAU software to make sure it's not garbled.
If the program is garbled,you need to "Control panel > Clock and Area > Area > Manage > Language of non Unicode programs." Click “Change system locale”. 
In the open dialog box, change the current system locale to Japanese (Japan) And then restart your computer to apply.

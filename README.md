# UTAU_Song_Preview_Script
This is a script for outputting and previewing the voice synthesis software of [UTAU - 歌声合成ツール (Windows Ver)](https://utau-synth.com).  
I'm not finished it yet.
It will take me more time to write it.

# Attention!
__Only can used in Chinese Windows 10 environment!__  
You need to open the UTAU software to make sure it's not garbled.
If the program is garbled,you need to "Control panel > Clock and Area > Area > Manage > Language of non Unicode programs." Click “Change system locale”. 
In the open dialog box, change the current system locale to Japanese (Japan) And then restart your computer to apply.
